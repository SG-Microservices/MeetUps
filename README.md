## Introduction

`Microservices` is a trending concept in recent years. It's getting non-stop attention from technical-relation people and organization from software developers, DevOps engineers, startups and even enterprises.

However, `microservices` is not a new concept. The concept has been there for like decades. It's all about breaking down your software into smaller modules until they are independent and serve only single responsibility.

Therefore, by saying `microservices`, I do not mention only about using tools like Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes,... but also about proper software architecture, clean code & best practices.

## Schedule

The meetup was founded on 11/11/2017 and planned to have meetups on **double date** of each months: Dec 12th, Jan 1st, Feb 2nd,...

However some dates may fall into weekends or public holiday (e.g: Jan 1st) or the host is simply busy on that dates. In such case, the meetup will be arranged within 5,6 days around. Alternatively an **online meetup** may be arranged instead to keep us always up!
